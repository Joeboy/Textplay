# Configuring Textplay
# ====================
# 
# Using Fountain's `key:value` title-page syntax, you can control how
# textplay interperets your screenplay. The following values can
# be customized:
#
#     * title (for metadata only) -- default: "A Screenplay"
# 
#       You can define what name textplay uses when generating files.
#  
#     * goldman_sluglines -- default: ON
# 
#       By defualt textplay interprets any line that's all-caps as a
#       slugline.
# 
#     * screenbundle_comments -- default: ON
# 
#       To provide backwards-compatibility with screenbundle documents,
#       textplay interprets any line starting with 2 slahes `//` as comments.
# 
#     * font -- default: "Courier Prime"
# 
#       By default textplay uses "Courier Prime" <http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/>
#       a great alternative font for screenwriters. If you don't have that
#       installed plain Courier will be used.
#   
#       If you'd like to specify your own font, Courier Prime and Courier
#       will be used as backup fonts.
# 
#     * slugline_spacing -- default: 1
# 
#       By default textplay puts a single empty line above sluglines, you
#       can change this to any number you want.
# 
#     * bold_sluglines -- default: ON
#     * underlined_sluglines -- default: OFF
# 
#     * header -- empty by default
# 
#       Header information is displayed on every page, use this for
#       revision numbers, dates, etc.
# 
#     * footer -- empty by default
# 
#       Any information you'd like in the footer of every page can go here.
# 
# 
# For the time being, all other key/values are preserved as meta-data in
# the document, but otherwise ignored.
# 
# 
# 
# To set these values just define the key/values at the beginning of the
# document like this:
# 
# title: Ron's Woodland Adventure
# font: Courier New
# goldman_sluglines: off
# bold_sluglines: on
# 
# The block of key/value pairs:
#    a. Must be the first non-comment thing in the document.
#    b. Options CAN be wrapped in boneyard comments or notes
#    c. Options must NOT be indented
#    d. The block of option key/value pairs cannot contain more than
#       1 empty line. 2 empty lines will cause textplay to stop parsing
#       for options.
#
